# Deep-RL-Bootcamp-Labs-Solutions
This is based on the labs of the bootcamp https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/home?authuser=0

To follow up you need to start with the prepration in the prelab folder 

I try to solve the labs and sometimes add more usefull insignts





possible errors when runing docker commands:


1. Permission denied error on the .sh file or on a python file

you may need to give execute permission on the sh file, and the files it calls (python files or .sh files)

chmod +x fileName


2. netstat: command not found (in lab3)
you can solve it by installing
sudo apt install net-tools
